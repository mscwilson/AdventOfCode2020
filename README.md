# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions for days 1-13 of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), using Ruby.

I successfully completed both parts of the challenge for days 1-12, and part 1 of day 13. Decided to call it a day there and enjoy my Christmas holidays!

These Advent of Code problems were my first time experiencing challenges that needed recursion to solve, or where efficiency had to be considered. For several of the puzzles (including day 13) I initially wrote code that gave the right answer for the test data but was so inefficient that it ran forever on the real input. I'm particularly proud of my day 7 solution (counting bags inside bags).

I also learned the importance of copying/deepcopying objects using dup, such as in day 11's "simultaneous" seat filling.

I'm looking forward to Advent of Code 2021 -  hopefully I will be able to complete the puzzles more easily by then!
